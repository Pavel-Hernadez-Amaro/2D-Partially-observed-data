The data set is the 1st of the one we have seen:

DATASET 1:  air quality classifier from photos

https://github.com/nileshparab42/Air-Pollution-Classification/blob/main/README.md

IND_and_NEP: This subfolder contains six different subfolders representing six different classes of AQI (nos quedar√≠amos con 2 clases). The csv file in this folder contains all the data and its parameters. It is labeled as

Location, Filename, Year, Month, Day, Hour, AQI, PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, NO2, and AQI_Class.

The link for the data set is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshrouniyar/air-pollution-image-dataset-from-india-and-nepal


You will see all this in the R code but here is a short summary of the data set we are using and our procedure:

We are focusing on the region of "Dimapur". This region only have two classification "b_Moderate" "c_Unhealthy_for_Sensitive_Groups"

That is why I am focusing on this particular region.

On this region we have 350 pictures of 224x224 pixel we are using 60x220 on some cases I have extended to 70x220.

I think I have also tried with 70x200. In my computer when I try to use the entire picture it gives me storage errors.

I add one gap of a specific size in every image. The size of the gap is linked with the errors.
